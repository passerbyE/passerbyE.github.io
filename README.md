    <h1>Hi, I'm victo_lin ðŸ‘‹</h1>
    <p>
      I'm a high school student from Taiwan interested in 
      <b>computer science</b>, <b>network security</b>, and <b>game development</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Iâ€™ve worked on projects such as a <q>3D gravity-flipping Unity game</q> 
      and a <q>fully automated warehouse robot system</q>.  
    </p>
    <p>
      My goal is to study <i>Computer Science and Information Engineering</i> at Taipei Tech 
      and contribute to open-source projects while learning more about security research.  
    </p>
    <p>
      This GitHub Page is mainly for <q>testing</q>, sharing my projects, 
      and recording my growth in coding.
